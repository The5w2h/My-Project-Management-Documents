This is a grouping of files I've collected over the years. It may grow, it may shrink. These files have all been used by me at one point or another, and reflect a few decades of trial and error. You will notice that I have some Excel reports in here. I hate using Excel for project management, but I recognize that not all organizations can or will buy dedicated software. Use these at your own risk. I won't support them, and don't ask me to.

Same with file types, some of these were created, or last used years ago. If you can't open it, I'm not fixing it. I didn't create all of these, and in some cases I may have only used them a few times until I found something better. Feel free to change them to your own purpose.

If you want to participate in this file collection, message me on the various platform where you found the link.
